# 11. Writing Reports {#reporting}

The learning objectives for this session are:
- Apply the 

The next section explains some of the theoretical assumptions used in the customer survey. 

# Service Quality
The penultimate page of the survey started with two items related to the customer's relationship with their service provider. Customers were asked to indicate whether they struggle to pay their water bills when they fall due, using a seven-point Likert scale from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree". 

The second question asked customers to indicate the frequency at which they contact their utility for support, also using a seven-point Likert scale: 
* Never
* Less than Once a Month
* Once a Month
* 2-3 Times a Month
* Once a Week
* 2-3 Times a Week
* Daily

The final item of the questionnaire consisted of an open question which invited customers to provide additional comments about their tap water supplier.
